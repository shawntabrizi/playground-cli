/**
 * Pin the equivalence between (a) what `signerMode.ts` actually
 * synthesises for dev-mode playground publish, (b) bulletin-deploy's
 * `DEFAULT_MNEMONIC` bare-root account, and (c) the well-known canonical
 * SS58 for that account. This is load-bearing: bulletin-deploy uses the
 * bare-mnemonic root for storage + DotNS when no explicit signer is
 * provided, so the CLI must sign the registry publish with the SAME
 * account to keep `is_authorized_to_republish`, the DotNS name owner,
 * and the registry publisher coherent across iterations.
 *
 * The test fails closed in three independent ways:
 *   - upstream `bulletin-deploy` changes its default mnemonic
 *   - the CLI swaps `seedToAccount(DEFAULT_MNEMONIC, "")` for something
 *     else (e.g. `createDevSigner("Alice")`, which would be `//Alice`)
 *   - the canonical literal changes (it shouldn't — pinning the literal
 *     guards against silent equivalence drift in the SDK)
 *
 * Historical footgun: `createDevSigner("Alice")` from
 * `@parity/product-sdk-tx` uses `//Alice` derivation (`5Grwva…`). That
 * is a DIFFERENT account from bulletin-deploy's bare-mnemonic root
 * (`5DfhGyQd…`). The first version of this code mixed the two; this
 * test exists so the mistake can't recur silently.

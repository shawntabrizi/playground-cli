/**
 * Resolves *which* signer is used for each on-chain step of a deploy. This
 * is the only module that knows the full matrix; everywhere else receives
 * already-composed objects so a future mainnet profile can swap in without
 * rewriting callers.
 *
 * Today (testnet):
 *   - Dev mode: bulletin-deploy uses its built-in default mnemonic for
 *     storage AND DotNS. Playground publish (if enabled) still uses the
 *     user's phone signer so myApps ownership lands on the correct address.
 *   - Phone mode: bulletin-deploy uses the user's phone signer for DotNS
 *     (3 taps). Storage always uses the bulletin-deploy pool mnemonic.
 *     Playground publish uses the user's phone signer (1 more tap).

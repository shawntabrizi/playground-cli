/**
 * Resolves *which* signer is used for each on-chain step of a deploy. This
 * is the only module that knows the full matrix; everywhere else receives
 * already-composed objects so a future mainnet profile can swap in without
 * rewriting callers.
 *
 * Today (testnet):
 *   - Dev mode: storage + DotNS go through bulletin-deploy's built-in
 *     mnemonic (or `--suri`) — passed EXPLICITLY, never via bulletin-deploy's
 *     own fallback chain. Since 0.8.x, `deploy()` called with no mnemonic /
 *     signer / suri resolves the persisted SSO session on disk
 *     (`~/.polkadot-apps/dot-cli_SsoSessions.json`, the same namespace
 *     `playground init` writes) and phone-signs DotNS — so an empty options
 *     object silently turns dev mode into phone mode for any logged-in user.
 *     Likewise, an absent `storageSigner` makes it auto-read the user's
 *     cached BulletInAllowance slot key and burn their phone-granted quota
 *     on chunk uploads. Dev mode therefore pins all three: `mnemonic` for
 *     DotNS, `storageSigner` for chunks, and the dev publish signer below.
 *     Playground publish is ALSO signed by the dev
 *     account — Alice's H160 is recorded as `publisher`, but the contract
 *     accepts an optional `owner` parameter so we can record the user's
 *     H160 as the `owner` (the H160 MyApps queries with). When a phone
 *     session is present we pass `claimedOwnerH160 = session.productH160`
 *     so the user still sees the app in MyApps without ever tapping the
 *     phone. With no session, `claimedOwnerH160 = null` and the contract
 *     falls back to caller (dev account owns the app).
 *   - Phone mode: bulletin-deploy uses the user's phone signer for DotNS
 *     (3 taps). Storage uses the BulletInAllowance slot key resolved by
 *     `resolveStorageSignerOptions` — NEVER the phone signer (see that
 *     function's doc for why). Playground publish uses the user's phone
 *     signer (1 more tap). `claimedOwnerH160 = null` — the contract
 *     defaults to caller, which is the user's H160 anyway.

/**
 * Resolve the signer for Bulletin STORAGE txs (the CAR chunk uploads),
 * threaded to bulletin-deploy as `storageSigner` / `storageSignerAddress`.
 * Every mode pins one explicitly: phone+session uses the local
 * BulletInAllowance slot key, `--suri` uses the caller's key, and dev mode
 * uses the dev bare-root — leaving it absent lets bulletin-deploy 0.8.x
 * auto-read the user's cached slot key and burn their quota (see below).
 *
 * Why this exists: since bulletin-deploy 0.8.x, passing `signer` routes
 * Bulletin storage through that signer too — not just DotNS. Chunk txs carry
 * up to 2 MiB of callData, and the phone session signer forwards the FULL
 * callData over the statement store (`session.createTransaction`), whose
 * request-size cap is 4 KiB on the pinned host-papp 0.7.9 (254 KiB upstream,
 * and the Android app itself caps statements at 256 KiB). A phone-signed
 * chunk therefore fails client-side with "message too big" before the phone
 * is ever contacted. bulletin-deploy's `storageSigner` takes precedence over
 * `signer` for storage routing only, so DotNS keeps the phone signer while
 * chunks sign locally. bulletin-deploy 0.8.3 can resolve the same slot key
 * itself from the shared `dot-cli` allowance cache, but only as a best-effort
 * side path — when it misses (fresh machine, declined grant) it silently
 * falls back to phone-signing the chunks, so we resolve and pass the key
 * explicitly and fail fast with an actionable message instead.
 *
 * Resolution is delegated to `allowances/bulletin.ts::getBulletinAllowanceSigner`
 * — the single source for slot allocation (cache hit → silent; miss → one
 * phone approval) and the quota check + `Increase` flow when `quota` is
 * provided. Key derivation is the SDK's (`@parity/product-sdk-terminal`
 * 0.3.1+ derives the schnorrkel-normalized address the chain granted to).
 *
 * Pass `quota` ({ bulletinApi, requiredBytes }) when the upload size is
 * known: the slot's on-chain extent is verified up front and an undersized
 * allowance triggers a single `Increase` request on the phone, instead of
 * the upload dying mid-flight with Payment errors (which do NOT fall back
 * to the pool — only a first-connection failure does).
 *
 * Quota shortfall is WARN-AND-PROCEED, never a block: whether the chain
 * enforces the authorization extent at `store()` time is unconfirmed
 * (upstream guidance is "the authorization is what counts", i.e. existence
 * and expiry). After the Increase attempt the resolution retries without
 * the quota check, surfaces `quota.onWarning`, and the deploy continues
 * with the slot signer — bulletin-deploy reports per-chunk truth if the
 * extent does turn out to be enforced. Only a total resolution failure
 * (no slot key at all, grant declined) aborts the deploy.
 *
 * Dev and `--suri` deploys pin `storageSigner` to their own local key
 * instead of returning `{}`. bulletin-deploy 0.8.x auto-reads the user's
 * cached BulletInAllowance slot key whenever `storageSigner` is absent and
 * signs chunk uploads with it — silently burning the user's small
 * phone-granted quota (~10 txs / 4 MiB per grant) on deploys that were
 * supposed to run entirely on dev accounts. The dev bare-root carries its
 * own Bulletin authorization on paseo-next-v2; if it ever lapses,
 * bulletin-deploy's committed-signer wrapper falls back to the shared pool
 * (the pre-0.8 dev storage path) without aborting. A `--suri` key is the
 * caller's responsibility per the CI escape hatch contract — unauthorized
 * keys land on the pool fallback the same way.

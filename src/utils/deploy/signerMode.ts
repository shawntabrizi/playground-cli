/**
 * Resolves *which* signer is used for each on-chain step of a deploy. This
 * is the only module that knows the full matrix; everywhere else receives
 * already-composed objects so a future mainnet profile can swap in without
 * rewriting callers.
 *
 * Today (testnet):
 *   - Dev mode: storage + DotNS go through bulletin-deploy's built-in
 *     mnemonic (or `--suri`). Playground publish is ALSO signed by the dev
 *     account — Alice's H160 is recorded as `publisher`, but the contract
 *     accepts an optional `owner` parameter so we can record the user's
 *     H160 as the `owner` (the H160 MyApps queries with). When a phone
 *     session is present we pass `claimedOwnerH160 = session.productH160`
 *     so the user still sees the app in MyApps without ever tapping the
 *     phone. With no session, `claimedOwnerH160 = null` and the contract
 *     falls back to caller (dev account owns the app).
 *   - Phone mode: bulletin-deploy uses the user's phone signer for DotNS
 *     (3 taps). Storage always uses the bulletin-deploy pool mnemonic.
 *     Playground publish uses the user's phone signer (1 more tap).
 *     `claimedOwnerH160 = null` — the contract defaults to caller, which
 *     is the user's H160 anyway.

 * the same account, so `is_authorized_to_republish` accepts dev iteration
 * uniformly and the DotNS name owner equals the registry publisher for
 * dev-mode apps.
 *
 * Derived once at module load to avoid re-running BIP-39 + sr25519 on
 * every `resolveSignerSetup` call.
 *
 * `DEV_PUBLISH_ADDRESS` is exported so callers (e.g. the availability
 * preflight) can pass it as the expected DotNS owner whenever dev mode
 * will fall back to bulletin-deploy's default mnemonic.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: do NOT swap to `createDevSigner("Alice")` from
 * `@parity/product-sdk-tx`. That helper uses `//Alice` derivation
 * (`5Grwva...`), which is a DIFFERENT account from bulletin-deploy's
 * bare-mnemonic root (`5DfhGyQd...`). The `signerModeAlice.test.ts`

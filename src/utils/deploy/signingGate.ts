/**
 * A per-account mutex that serializes the on-chain signing phases of a deploy.
 *
 * ── Why this exists (the nonce-safety contract) ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every on-chain extrinsic in a deploy — bulletin-deploy's DotNS
 * register/setContenthash and Bulletin chunk `store()` calls, plus our own
 * `registry.publish()` and metadata `store()` — derives its nonce by reading
 * the account's *current* on-chain next-index at submission time
 * (`system_accountNextIndex` inside bulletin-deploy; polkadot-api's
 * `signSubmitAndWatch` for the publish path). None of these accept a
 * caller-supplied incrementing nonce.
 *
 * That is fine for a single deploy, but when several apps deploy concurrently
 * **from the same signer** (e.g. the Arcade's six `.dot` apps all signed by
 * `--signer dev`), two in-flight deploys read the same next-index and submit
 * two extrinsics with the same nonce. The pool accepts one and rejects the
 * other ("nonce too low" / replaced) — the classic shared-signer race.
 *
 * Rather than reimplement bulletin-deploy's per-tx nonce logic, we make the
 * race impossible by construction: a `SigningGate` is a FIFO mutex keyed by
 * signer address. Each concurrent deploy still builds and prepares in parallel,
 * but acquires the gate before entering its signing phase(s) and releases it
 * after, so at most one deploy per account is ever submitting extrinsics at a
 * time. While one deploy holds the gate its nonces advance to completion before
 * the next deploy reads the next-index, so every read sees a settled value.
 *
 * Deploys signed by *different* accounts get different gates (or no gate) and
 * run fully in parallel — only same-account submission is serialized.
 *
 * The gate is intentionally tiny and dependency-free: a promise chain. It does
 * NOT throttle builds or Bulletin uploads (the slow parts) — only the signing
 * critical section, which is what the chain forces to be sequential anyway.
 */

    /**
     * Run `fn` while holding the gate. Acquisitions are granted in FIFO order.

            // deploy releases the gate for the next one instead of poisoning the
            // chain — each caller still sees its own `fn`'s result/throw.
